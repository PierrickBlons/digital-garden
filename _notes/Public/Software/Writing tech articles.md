This is a meta article to reflect and think about the way of writing technical articles.

It's not an easy task for me to write and share it in the wild of the internet. Especially now that you can see so much high quality content on different platforms, sites, blogs or social networks. 

I always feel like I'm not adding much on a given subject, that I'm mostly rewriting or paraphrasing what I read. But when discussing with other fellow tech people I always realize we had very interesting conversations that need to dig deeper into some specific topics and the outcome might be worth being shared. The idea is definitely not to provide direct answers but at least sharing the questions we had and how we tried to answer them.

Back to writing here, after discovering the digital garden concept in the brilliant article from Maggie Appleton [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I realized that it might fit well with this idea of sharing content. Having some ideas or practices being explore and the content growing while experimenting it.

So writing is the practice explored here alongside the different topics you'll find in this garden. I know nothing about writing or storytelling. This is really an exploration of the topic applied to technical writing. 

At the moment, the question is more how to write tech articles. Can storytelling techniques  help writing things more easily? How to know it's actually good or should it be improved? Can we measure an article quality?
