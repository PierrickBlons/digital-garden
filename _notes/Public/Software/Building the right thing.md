## Building the right thing (hopefully right)

Building software is a journey into different domains. You need to be a little bit curious about the world around you.  As software developers it's critical to understand what real problem we are trying to solve. 

There a many ways to discover the intricate details of a domain. The sure thing is that it's a collaborative effort and it involves a variety of people.

How can we learn from each others? 

There are few workshops format helping building a shared understanding of a domain to help find the right thing to build:

- Impact Mapping
- Event Storming
- [[Domain Storytelling]]
- Example Mapping
- Lean Coffee
- Event modeling
- User story mapping

For the hopefully right part of the title, this is another story. It's linked to the team technical skills.
