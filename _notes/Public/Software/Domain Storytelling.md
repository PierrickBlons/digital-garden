### Introduction
Let's start with a story explaining what Domain Storytelling is.

*Example from the highly recommended book [Domain Storytelling](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58385794) by [Stefan Hofer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hofstef/?locale=en_US) and [Henning Schwentner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henningschwentner/)*

The above diagram could be read out loud like this:

>*Domain expert tells domain story to developers. 
>Developers draw the domain story using the domain storytelling pictographic language.
>Domain expert read the transcribed story out loud and corrects it if needed.*

This is the result of a domain storytelling session between domain experts and developers. The goal of domain storytelling is to help domain expert telling stories about their beloved domain.

This will help the entire team or even organization to better understand the domain, getting everyone involved closer by sharing a common language (ubiquitous language) and helping building the right thing right.
### How do we get there? 

Simple! By talking together üòä 

While talking someone who knows about the pictographic language of Domain Storytelling will transcribe the conversation and the learning to the canvas.
### Pictographic language

#### Actor
In our example the first thing to look at is the "domain expert".

This is an **actor**. They are usually represented by different icons and can be a single person or role, a group of people or even a system. 
#### Work objects

Actors are able to do thing with **work objects**. It can really be anything from a real object to a digital version of it or some concept as well like a price or money. 

All **work objects** are linked with **actors** with activities.
#### Activities
This is were is action take place. **Actors** and **work objects** are described with nouns while activities are verbs.

This is where Domain Storytelling is really bringing value and structure into the representation. **Activities** are numbered in sequence so it's easy to follow the story. This will help to read and correct the story when a first iteration will be achieve.

In the Domain Storytelling jargon we now have our first **sentence**. This concept of sentence is really important because it's helping to scale the workshop format (remote or in person) and also to know if you are not creating a too broad of too detailed story. 
### Scope

#### Granularity
Metaphor for Granularity (inspired from Alistair Cockburn - [Writing Effective Use Cases](https://www-public.imtbs-tsp.eu/~gibson/Teaching/Teaching-ReadingMaterial/Cockburn00.pdf))

- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud level
- ü™Å Kite level
- üåä Sea level
- üê† Fish level
- üêö Clam level
#### Purity
Pure vs Digitalize
#### Point in time
AS-IS
TO-BE

A story scope will be described by the association of those three properties

Example: (SEA LEVEL, PURE, AS-IS)
